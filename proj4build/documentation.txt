I'm using the grace period for this project.

HVZ B

Game Description:
A simulation of humans vs zombies demonstrating several steering forces.

User Interaction:
You can...
	...add a human/duck at a random place using "H"
	...remove all humans/ducks by using "H + shift"
	...add a zombie/cat at a random place using "Z"
	...remove all zombies/cats by using "Z + shift"
	...add food at a random place using "F"
	...remove all food by using "F + shift"
	...reset the game to one zombie and four ducks using "R"
	...show debug lines by holding "L"
	...slow everything down using "-"
	...speed everything up using "+"
	...pause everything using "0"
	...play everything at normal speed using "1"

Above and beyond:
The game allows the user to speed up and slow down or speed up or pause the entire game
 using the -, +, 0, and 1 keys.
The game allows the user to delet all of one type of object. (This is mostly if you want to get a clearer look at how
 the ducks seek the food)

Known Issues:
Changing the speed of the game can mess up the debug lines and cause them to extend
into infinity.
Because the positions of new humans are generated randomly, sometimes adding a human can result in it 
spawning on a zombie and immediately being consumed, thus looking like it only spawned a zombie.
For the same reason, humans, zombies, and food can all be spawned inside an obstacle.
Food can also be spawned on top of a human, making it look like the food was not spawned.
